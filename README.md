## Hi there, I'm Sherry 👋

I'm a software engineer with experience in backend development, distributed systems, and ML infrastructure. 

I just wrapped up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), where I focused on computer systems, programming languages, and Rust. Prior to this, I was at Lyft, where I worked first in Payments and then in Marketplace (Pricing/Matching).
